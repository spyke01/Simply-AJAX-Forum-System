Description:
----------------------------------
The Fast Track Sites Simply AJAX Forum System(SAFS for short) is a simple to use, extremely powerful, and secure forum system. This system is full of eye catching AJAX features and is bassed on our popular SSFORUM application. This new version includes a completely rewritten backend, a new admin panel, better theme capabilities, more options, and is even more secure than its predecessor.

It would be impossible to list all of its features, but below are a few:

    * AJAX used for posting, deleting, locking and unlocking topics
    * Word Filter - Can be used to block unwanted words from showing up in posts or instant messages
    * Topic Icons - Comes with several free icons and more can be easily added
    * Announcements - You can now create forum-wide announcements that will show up at the top of each page.
    * Progress Spinners - We have added progress spinners to most of the AJAX sections so that you will know that your request is being done
    * Hide/Show Buttons - You can hide or show almost any item in the system so that you only see what you want to
    * Account Activation Options - Administrators can now require users to activate their accounts via email before logging in
    * AJAX Validation - Helps you diagnose problems when creating new accounts
    * Username and Email Checker - Check and see if the username you want is already in use, you can also check to see if you have registered before
    * And Much Much More!!



The professional version includes a 1yr warranty with full access to technical support by phone, web, or email, topic icons, profanity filter, and much more.

Installation:
----------------------------------
Extract the files to your web directory.
Chmod _db.php to 777
Chmod .htaccess to 777
Fill out all of your information and submit the form.
Delete install.php
Chmod _db.php to 755
Chmod .htaccess to 755
Enjoy!

Editing Database Connection Settings:
------------------------------------------ 
In rare cases, the installer will be unable to create the _db.php file correctly, this is usually because of the file not being chmodded correctly.

If this happens, you will need to manually edit _db.php for your db settings.
